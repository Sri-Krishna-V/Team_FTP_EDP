# OLabs-EDP

## README for Team-FTP Project

### Introduction

The Team-FTP project is designed to enhance Entrepreneurship Development Programs (EDPs) by integrating cutting-edge AI technologies to support entrepreneurial skill assessment, market analysis, and capital management. This project aims to create a comprehensive ecosystem that empowers EDP-trained individuals with the tools and resources needed to succeed in the business world.

### Objectives

1. **GAP Analysis/Assessment AI**
   - **Objective**: Develop an interactive question-and-answer chatbot to evaluate students' current entrepreneurial skills and knowledge.
   - **Outcome**: Generate a detailed SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) based on user responses.
   - **Technology**: Utilize the Perplexity API for conversational AI and LangChain for building the chatbot with memory and context management.

2. **Market Analysis and Economic Research AI**
   - **Objective**: Create an AI tool to provide insights into market segmentation, scalability, accessibility, and other economic factors.
   - **Features**: Conduct industry research and deliver actionable data analysis tailored for OLabs.
   - **Technology**: Leverage LangChain to integrate tools for advanced data analysis and conversational interaction.

3. **Capital Management**
   - **Objective**: Establish a hub for EDP-trained individuals to connect with investors, incubators, and government funding bodies.
   - **Features**:
     - Present a proof-of-concept (POC) networking interface.
     - Include a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) AI tool that matches users’ ideas with relevant MSME schemes and government funding opportunities.
     - Provide detailed eligibility reports with expected funding from available schemes.
   - **Technology**: Build the RAG AI using LangChain and the Perplexity API for intelligent matchmaking.

### Tools & Frameworks

- **Perplexity API**: Utilized for natural language processing and interactive chat capabilities.
- **LangChain**: Employed to build chatbots with memory, context management, and integration of various tools.

### Project Structure

The project is structured into the following components:

- **Backend**: Contains the API and database schemes necessary for data storage and retrieval.
- **Frontend**: Handles user interaction and visual presentation of the application.
- **Database**: Stores user data, SWOT analyses, market research insights, and funding opportunities.
- **Requirements**: Lists all necessary dependencies and libraries for running the project.
